I'm porting his work because, like the Flanders, I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas.\r\n\r\nI'm also learning Kotlin with JavaFX because...reasons/fun.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n- Java 8\r\n\r\n### Gradle\r\n[Gradle][2] is really awesome, I love using it for lots of reasons; not the least of which is the ease of sharing projects with others with the least amount of setup effort.\r\n\r\nUse the Gradle wrapper `./gradlew` on MacOS/Linux, or `gradlew.bat` on Windows.  This will ensure that you are using the correct version of Gradle for this project.\r\n\r\nAll project dependencies will be downloaded automatically, including the correct version of Gradle.\r\n\r\n#### build\r\n`./gradlew clean build`\r\nThis will compile the source, run tests/checks, and create distribution artifacts in `build/distributions`\r\n\r\nDistribution artifacts contain a `bin` folder that includes both a shell script `./bin/pcrek` and a bat file `bin/pcrek.bat` for executing the application.  The `lib` folder will contain all required runtime jars.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### run\r\n`./gradlew run`\r\n\r\n#### test\r\n`./gradlew test`\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n*cricket noises*\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/SenorPez/project-cars-replay-enhancer\r\n[2]: https://gradle.org\r\n",
